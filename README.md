# Smart Traffic AI Control

This project proposes an intelligent traffic light control system using AI, image processing, and real-time video data to manage urban congestion more efficiently. It leverages deep learning models like YOLOv6, VGG16, and SSD to dynamically adjust traffic light signals based on vehicle density.

## Features

- Real-time traffic density estimation
- Dynamic green/red signal timing
- YOLOv6 and VGG16 based object detection
- OpenCV video stream analysis
- Python-based with model training support
- Comparison metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow & Keras
- YOLOv6, SSD, VGG16 models
- Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)
2. Train models or use pretrained weights
3. Run traffic detection using:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4. Quit live detection with `q` key.

## Results

- Improved traffic flow
- Reduced wait time and fuel consumption
- Less urban congestion
